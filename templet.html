									Right after its USD 645 million IPO, the Company had evolved into a fraud by fabricating financial and operating numbers starting in 3" quarter 2019.
Not surprisingly, it wasted no time to successfully raise another USD 1.1 billion (including secondary placement) in January 2020.
We mobilized 92 full-time and 1,418 part-time staff on the ground to run surveillance and record store traffic for 981 store-days covering 100% of the operating hours.
Smoking Gun Evidence #3: We gathered 25,843 customer receipts and found that Luckin inflated its net selling price per item by at least RMB 1.23 or 12.3% to artificially sustain the business model.
It’s possible that Luckin recycled its overstated advertising expense back to inflate revenue and store-level profit.
Smoking Gun Evidence #5: Luckin’s revenue contribution from “other products” was only about 6% in 2019 3Q, representing nearly 400% inflation, as shown by 25,843 customer receipts and its reported VAT numbers.
Red Flag #3: Through acquisition of Borgward, Luckin’s Chairman Charles Zhengyao Lu transferred RMB 137 million from UCAR (838006 CH) to his related party, Baiyin Wang.
UCAR, Borgward, and Baiyin Wang are on the hook to pay BAIC-Foton Motors RMB 5.95 billion over the next 12 months.
Now Baiyin Wang owns a recently founded coffee machine vendor located next door to Luckin’s Headquarter.
Red Flag #6: Luckin’s co-founder & Chief Marketing Officer, Fei Yang, was once sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment for crime of illegal business operations when he was the co-founder and general manager of Beijing Koubei Interactive Marketing & Planning Co.,Ltd.
Business Model Flaw #1: Luckin’s proposition to target core functional coffee demand is wrong: China’s caffeine intake level of 86mg/day per capita is comparable to other Asian countries already, with 95% of the intake from tea.
Business Model Flaw #4: Luckin’s dream “to be part of everyone’s everyday life, starting with coffee” is unlikely to come true, as it lacks core competence in non-coffee products as well.
“The stock’s gains have almost all come in the past two months, after the company said it had become profitable at a store level in the quarter through September.”
The location type was decided by analyzing the detailed address of Luckin’s stores: we separated them into office, mall, school, residential, transportation, hotel and others.

The Items per order assumption is generous already, and details are presented in Smoking Gun Evidence 2 below.
Since there are 8 internal surveillance cameras in each of Luckin’s stores covering it with no blind angle (Link), investors/auditors can ask the Company to provide surveillance videos and sample them randomly to check against reported order numbers.

During our tracking period of 2019 4Q to Jan 2020, Luckin APP’s average DAU per store was 0.59K, and Luckin’s 2019 3Q and 2019 4Q’s average DAU per store was 11% and 0% lower than that of our tracking period, respectively.

This method cannot be used if Luckin intentionally jumps and skips numbers during the day to purposely distort the tracking results.
Here is an evidence of its notice to store managers to watch out for jumping pick-up numbers on Nov 23" 2019.
Though we can’t publish the videos due to privacy reasons, we encourage investors to conduct the research themselves: Stay in a store for 0.5-1 hour and count the number of orders picked up by customers or delivery personnel.
However, here is the clever part: company management likely thought about the possibility that more and more investors and data firms were starting to track their order numbers themselves as part of the due diligence process, so “jumping orders” is a simple way to mislead investors.
Smoking Gun Evidence #2: Luckin’s “Items per order” has declined from 1.38 in 2019 2Q to 1.14 in 2019 4Q
This marked a continuously downward trend of items per order from 1.74 in 2018 1Q to 1.14 in 2019 4Q.
This trend can be attributed to the decline of delivery order contribution, as people naturally tend to buy more items to meet the free shipping requirement.
Through our store visits, we find that the majority pick-up customers only buy one freshly brewed drink, because in most cases, a coupon can only be applied to one of the items in the order, according to Luckin.
Per company presentation and management communication, the percentage of delivery orders indeed declined from 61.7% in 2018 1Q to 12.8%
Delivery 1s a tool to help Improve perception of convenience for the customer (does require some subsidies from the retailer)
Source: 25,843 customer receipts, Luckin APP, Coffee_Detective Calculation In addition, items per order is independent to store types or city tiers, as indicated below.
Therefore, there’s zero impact on the result by simulating a perfect match to the population distribution.

Smoking Gun Evidence #3: We gathered 25,843 customer receipts and found that Luckin inflated its net selling price per item by at least RMB 1.23 or 12.3% to artificially sustain the business model.
On the earnings conference call on Nov. 13, 2019, Luckin’s CFO & CSO Reinout Schakel guided even higher price for 2019 4Q.

At the same time, also, }we continue to increase the number of people that are already paying the price that we want them to pay|So it’s a trend that we have seen in Q2.
Applying a perfectly match to Luckin’s store distribution, the difference in net selling price will be no more than 1%.

On the aforementioned earnings call, Luckin’s CFO Reinout Schakel circumvented the question on increasing promotion intensity.
The percentage of free items is supposedly declining per company filings.

There’s no positive correlation between the net selling price per item and the operating months.
Quick post: Restaurant Industry: Luckin - CFO Takeaways from ICR... We caught up with Luckin's|CFO, Reinout Schakel:
The lower end of ASP below RMB 12, which is closer to the real case, is somehow omitted in management’s analysis, representing a much more struggling profitability outlook.
Take one step back, we give the company some credits for achieving economy of scale through sending free coffees and take down the costs at 2019 2Q reported numbers, the store level loss is still as high as 24.7%.

Store Level OPM Sensitivity Analysis —2019 2Q case with reported costs
Luckin disclosed its quarterly advertising expenses before Mar 31 2019 in its IPO prospectus.
After IPO, its advertising expenses can be calculated using the breakdown of new customer acquisition costs on its quarterly earnings release presenations.
Luckin’s reported selling and marketing expenses breakdown For the three months ended
08 cokulatad nea produc promation expanses wombar of naw traning customers Advertising expenses and others (RMB million) 44 246 387 ‘ering the pod Advertising expenses (RMB million) 40 242 382
The data tracked by CTR Market Research showed that Luckin overstated 2019 3Q advertising expenses by over 150%: 2019 3Q CTR implied Focus Media spending was RMB 46 million, only 12% of Luckin’s reported advertising expense, a much lower level than previous quarters.
Below are CTR’s monthly tracking results of Luckin’s advertising spending on Focus Media’s channels.
Luckin’s spending was reduced to a minimum level from September to November 2019, but rebounded in December 2019.
The dollar amount in CTR’s raw data is media list price, which could be significantly higher than the actual advertising spending.
To calculate the conversion rate between list price and advertising spending, we calculated it between CTR’s tracking of total Focus Media broadcasted advertisements with Focus Media (002027 CH)’s reported revenue.
CTR also publishes on their website monthly, quarterly and annual report of largest advertisers based on their tracking.

The real case in Luckin’s store level results are sales volume of 263 items per store per day sold at an ASP of RMB 9.97.
Coincidentally, the difference between Luckin’s reported advertising expense and its actual spending on Focus Media tracked by CTR is RMB 336 million, similar to the overstated store-level operating profit.
It’s possible that Luckin channeled its overstated advertising expense back to conduct the fraud in revenue and store-level profit.
Smoking Gun Evidence #5: Luckin’s revenue contribution from “other products” was only about 6% in 2019 3Q, representing a nearly 400% inflation, as shown by 25,843 customer receipts and its reported VAT numbers.
Its mission is to be “everyone’s everyday life, starting with coffee!” That makes “other products”, i.e. non-freshly brewed drinks, e.g. light meals, juices, nuts, mugs etc.
Luckin is enriching product offerings (~100 SKUs) to increase customer purchase frequency and sales revenue.
It captures more cross-selling opportunities by introducing selective new products complementary to the existing offerings and fulfill the target customers’ daily need
The 25,843 receipts further indicate that 4.9% and 17.5% of items for pick-up and delivery orders were “other products”, blended 6.2%, inflated by nearly 400%.
Again, people naturally tend to buy more “other products” for delivery orders to meet free shipping requirement.
But if the delivery order % decreased dramatically from 62% in 2018 2Q to almost 10% now, how come “% of revenue from other products” increased from 7% to 23% in the same period?
Luckin’s VAT rate in the latest Form F-1 Filing also supported our findings: According to State Tax Administration of the PRC, the VAT rates for selling goods and services are different.
For providing services, e.g. selling freshly brewed products, or delivery, the VAT rates are both subject to 6%.
With Luckin’s revenue breakdown, we can calculate a blended VAT rate
Weighted average on net revenue contribution % by product category, we find that the calculated VAT perfectly matched reported case in 2018 4Q, full year 2018 and 2019 1Q (refer to the line chart below), prior to IPO.
However, for 2019 2-3Q, the gap widened abruptly and sharply — reported VAT rate was 6.5% while calculated was 7.6%.
In that case, either the actual revenue contribution from “other products” was 6%-7% in 2019 3Q or Luckin was committing a
Net revenue (RMB mn) 465.4 840.7 478.5 2,450.7 VAT (RMB mn) 36.6 62.9 36.6 159.4 VAT rate - reported 7.9% 7.5% 7.6% 6.5% Difference vs. weighted average -0.1% -0.1% -0.1% -1.1% Net revenue % contribution - reported 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Freshly Brewed Drinks 74.5% 77.3% 75.5% 73.6% Other Products 19.6% 16.1% 17.6% 22.8% Others - delivery fees paid by customers 5.8% 6.6% 7.0% 3.6% VAT rate - weighted average calculated 8.0% 7.6% 7.8% 7.6% Freshly Brewed Drinks 6.0% 6.0% 6.0% 6.0% Other Products 16.0% 16.0% 16.0% 13.0% Others - delivery fees paid by customers 6.0% 6.0% 6.0% 6.0% How to get 6.5% VAT rate as reported?
It clearly shows 13% VAT rate for nuts, muffin, juice etc., and 6% for freshly brewed drinks and delivery fee.
Anyone who wants this information can require the VAT records through Luckin’s APP after purchase.

Luckin’s management stresses that they have never sold a single share of the Company; however, they have already cashed out through stock pledge financing.
Management can pledge their securities as collateral for loans from banks and brokerages.
When pledged shares fall in value, lenders demand that borrowers post more cash or collateral.
There are numerous cases of stock plunge driven by share pledge financing across Hong Kong and mainland China (please refer to articles below).

Red Flag #2: CAR (699 HK) déja vu: Charles Zhengyao Lu and the same group of closely-connected private equity investors walked away with USD 1.6 billion from CAR (699 HK) while minority shareholders took heavy losses
It was successfully listed in HKEX (stock code 699 HK) in 2014 after introducing strategic investment from Hertz (NYSE: HRI US).
Shareholding structure of CAR (699 HK) was Lenovo 29%, Warburg Pincus 18%, Hertz 16% and Charles Zhengyao Lu 15%.
Joy Capital’s founding partners, Erhai Liu and David Hui Li, led Lenovo and Warburg Pincus’ investment in CAR (699 HK) respectively.
There was a short period of “honeymoon” between CAR (699 HK) and capital market after IPO.
As you can see from the name, UCAR (838006 CH) is just another company controlled by Charles Zhengyao Lu: Lu and his concerted parties held close to 50% shares of UCAR (838006 CH) in 2016 and still 40% today.
In addition, CAR’s (699 HK) other pre-IPO investors, such as Hertz, Lenovo and Warburg Pincus, also sold significant amount of their shares during the same time.
From Jun, 2015 to Mar, 2016, Charles Zhengyao Lu and other pre-IPO investors cashed out USD 1.6 billion after dumping 42% of CAR’s (699 HK) total shares to the market in just 9 months.

CAR (699 HK) historical share price vs. insider selling (Sep, 2014 — Jun, 2016)
As Charles Zhengyao Lu and other pre-IPO investors walked away with USD 1.6 billion (not to mention USD 0.7 billion worth of remaining shares), public investors were left holding the bag.
In Jan, 2017, GeoInvesting published a short-selling report on CAR (699 HK) highlighting its “skyrocketing related party transactions” with UCAR (838006 CH), “questionable depreciation method” and “gloomy business outlook”.
The echoing patterns of CAR (699 HK) resonate when looking at Luckin’s recent share price performance.
Luckin’s major private equity investors Centurium Capital and Joy Capital’s founding partners David Hui Li and Erhai Liu actually led Warburg Pincus’ and Lenovo’s investment in CAR (699 HK) a few years ago, thus are “old friends” of Charles Zhengyao Lu.

We see the familiar “golden triangle” of Charles Zhengyao Lu, David Hui Li and Erhai Liu again in Luckin.
Given that “golden triangle” cashed out USD 1.1 billion from CAR (699 HK), what will happen to Luckin is self-explanatory.

Red Flag #3: Through acquisition of Borgward, Luckin’s Chairman Charles Zhengyao Lu transferred RMB 137 million from UCAR (838006 CH) to his related party, Baiyin Wang.
UCAR, Borgward, and Baiyin Wang are on the hook to pay BAIC-Foton Motors RMB 5.95 billion over the next 12 months.
Now Baiyin Wang owns a recently founded coffee machine vendor located next door to Luckin’s Headquarter
The transaction can be summarized as below: an individual called Baiyin Wang acquired a company in Jan, 2019 at RMB 3.97 billion, sold to UCAR (838006 CH) at RMB 4.11 billion in Mar, 2019 and made RMB137 million profit in just two months.
Founded in 1919, Borgward was once Top 4 German carmaker (the other three being Volkswagen, Benz and Opel) but went bankrupt in 1963.
In 2014, BAIC-Foton Motors (4ti%.7% 4, 600166 CH) acquired 100% shares of Borgward (“Beijing Borgward Automobile Co., Ltd” 4t7% % ‘Kit # A FR 4)) with EUR 5 million in 2014 and tried to re-introduce the legacy German auto brand into China market.
After several years of unsuccessful operations, BAIC-Foton Motors announced plan to sell 67% shares of Borgward in Oct, 2018 via public listing in China Beijing Equity Exchange (“dt 3% * 42 3% % Fr”).
On Jan 15", 2019, BAICFoton announced that the 67% shares of Borgward was sold to a company called “Changshengxingye” (““K &3$ 4k”, K&S dk
'& 2019-003), “Changshengxingye” was a shell company founded in Dec 3", 2018 specifically for this transaction and controlling shareholder and legal person is Baiyin Wang.

In other words, “Changshengxingye” made RMB 137 million profit in just two months by acquiring 67% of Borgward and quickly reselling to UCAR (838006 CH).
In other words, UCAR (838006 CH) was not only aware of Changshengxingye’s intention to acquire Borgward in the first place, but also helped to facilitate such transaction by providing RMB 2.4 billion credit guarantee.

UCAR (838006 CH) provides no more than RMB 2.4 billion credit guarantee to BAIC-Foton’s shareholder loan to Borgward in order to facilitate Changshengxingye’s acquisition of the target
It has been “public secret” that Baiyin Wang and Charles Zhengyao Lu maintain very close personal relationship (media article: fi sE92 [4H]: PAR oH,
Baiyin Wang and Charles Zhengyao Lu were EMBA classmates from 2006 to 2008 in National School of Development at Peking University (du AFH R RRA HME).
Baiyin Wang involved in a healthcare business after graduation and didn’t have any prior experience in automobile industry before acquiring Borgward.
Furthermore, we see alarming signal that UCAR (838006 CH) may face material cash flow pressure after acquisition of Borgward.
Regarding Changshengxingye’s acquisition of Borgward, payment to BAIC-Foton was due in full by Jan 15", 2020.
In other words, Changshengxingye only paid RMB 2.49 billion to BAIC-Foton for acquisition of Borgward and effectively defaults on the
RMB 2.4 billion of such shareholder loan is guaranteed by UCAR (838006 CH), as mentioned.
Adding the RMB 1.48 billion overdue acquisition payment, Changshengxingye and Borgward are facing RMB 5.95 billion cash outflow in next 12 months, signaling significant cash flow pressure.
Changshengxingye is an undisclosed related party of Charles Zhengyao Lu to bridge UCAR’s (838006 CH) acquisition of Borgward, thus its payment default and cash flow pressure trace back to UCAR (838006 CH).
In 1H19 interim filings, UCAR (838006 CH) disclosed that Borgward was already transferred to the company on Jul 29", 2019.

UCAR (838006 CH) hasn’t published 2019 30 financial report till now, despite almost 4 months after quarter end.
While Borgward itself is a loss-making business (RMB 2.545 billion net loss in 2018), UCAR (838006 CH) may need significant amount of external financing for the RMB 5.95 billion repayment to BAIC-Foton in next 12 months, not to mention support Borgward’s business development.
UCAR (838006 CH) currently is largest shareholder of CAR (699 HK) after Charles Zhengyao Lu’s cash-out in Mar, 2016.
However, the company has pledged RMB 3.89 billion worth of CAR’s (699 HK) shares for financing, as shown in 1H19 interim report.
UCAR (838006 CH) owns 631 million shares, or 29.77% of CAR’s (699 HK) total.
In other words, UCAR (838006 CH) already pledged almost 100% of its shareholding in CAR (699 Hk) in 1H19, echoing Red Flag #1.

In conclusion, Baiyin Wang set up multiple companies to supply coffee machine and food raw materials, which “coincidentally” locate next door to Luckin Headquarter.
In early January 2020 and barely 8 months after going public, Luckin raised another USD 865 million net new capital despite having RMB 5.5 billion cash on balance sheet.
Luckin Coffee Inc. Stock and Convertible Bond Offer Press Release
BEIJING, Jan. 17, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Luckin Coffee Inc. (“Luckin Coffee” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: LK), a pioneer of a technology-driven new retail model to provide coffee and other products of high quality, high affordability, and high convenience to customers, today announced the closing of the issuance of an additional 1.35 million American Depositary Shares (“ADSs"), each representing eight Class A ordinary shares of the Company, and 0.72 million ADSs offered by the selling shareholder, at US$42.00 per ADS, pursuant to the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase such additional ADSs in connection with the previously announced follow-on public ADSs offering (“the ADS Offering”).
The Company received net proceeds of approximately US$418.3 million in aggregate from the ADS offering, and net proceeds of approximately US$446.7 million in aggregate ifrom the Concurrent Note Offering.
The plan is to direct Luckin’s online traffic to these vending machines and management is expecting even better profitability than its offline stores due to lower costs.
Source: Company call transcripts CICC “Raising funds to expand into unmanned retail business” dated January 16" 2020: “Luckin plans to install 10,000 unmanned coffee machines and 100,000 vending machines, and we estimatetotal capex atabout Rmb3bn.”
The existing stores are only selling at an average price of RMB 10.9 per cup according to our receipt evidence, it’s unfathomable why customers are willing to pay 47% more for a product a vending machine product.
In addition, for a RMB 120k machine to have a 6 to 12 months pay-back, we calculate each machine needs to sell 122 to 220 cups of coffee per day with an average selling price of RMB 9 per cup.
If coffee EXPRESS is going to be as successful as the management claims, Luckin’s competitors can simply set up a machine at the same location.
Even worse, these vending machine competitors are already aiming to cannibalize Luckin’s offline stores.
They plan to populate 20 vending machines surrounding each of Luckin’s high traffic store and attack the company’s customer base through low price competition.
The broader “unmanned retail” market had also already seen waves of startups going bust over the past 2-3 years.
It used to be a popular concept in China venture capital industry, but the actual performances of unmanned retail startups were quite poor.
Unmanned retailers need to invest heavily in equipment and inventory and still rely on workers to complete product supply and machine cleaning/maintenance, so they are not necessarily cost-effective.
Competition from existing convenient stores and limited SKU has pressured the traffic growth of unmanned retail sites.
Even JD.com, the deep pocketed ecommerce giant with huge online traffic, pulled out from the unmanned retail container business at the end of 2018.

While enamored sell-side analysts are busy slapping an instantaneous US$13.2/ADS value creation based on the announcement of the “unmanned retail” aka vending machine strategy alone, we caution investors that this new business can be a perfect way for management to siphon large amount of cash from the company.
As pointed out in Red Flag #3 above, Charles Zhengyao Lu previously transferred RMB 137 million out from UCAR Inc. through transacting with an undisclosed related party, Baiyin Wang.
Baiyin Wang, on the other hand, now owns a coffee machine supplier that was just established in August 2019.
Our key assumptions are based on our discussion with the company, industry expert and local player.
Source: Credit Suisse “Luckin Coffee Spinning up the flywheel” dated January 15", 2020
In Luckin’s “unmanned retail” strategy press conference, CEO Jenny Zhiya Qian mentioned that “there is no upper limit of vending machine expansion target this year, the more the better”’.
We would suggest E&Y to audit the machine supplier closely, especially check for connected party transactions.

SEC’s Fraud Charges on Agria Corporation Washington D.C., Dec. 10, 2018 — A multinational agricultural company has agreed to pay
$3 million to settle charges that it concealed substantial losses from investors through fraudulent accounting in connection with its divestiture of its primary operating entity.
As described in the SEC's order, Agria Corporation sold its Chinese operating company in return foi stock and land use rights to 13,500 acres of undeveloped land in a remote, mountainous area of China’s Shanxi Province.
The SEC order found that Agria overstated the value of the stock it received by $17 million and assigned a value of nearly $60 million to the effectively worthless land use rights.
A separate SEC order found that in March 2013, Lai used nominee brokerage accounts to engage in manipulative trading in Agria’s American Depository Shares in order to inflate their price above $1 and prevent the securities from being delisted by the New York Stock Exchange.

Agria violated the anti-fraud, reporting, books and records, and internal accounting control provisions of the federal securities laws.
Between 2010 and 2013, Agria engaged in a course of fraudulent accounting related to its July 2010 divestiture of Taiyuan Primalights III Modernized Agriculture Development Co., Ltd. (“P3A”), a consolidated affiliated entity.
In doing so, Agria ignored controlling accounting guidance and manipulated its valuation of the shares it received

Almost all companies Sean Shao has been involved in have lost public investors significant amount of money.
On average, these stocks have lost 66% value compared to their peak market capitalizations.
We understand that business trends change, and stock price goes up and down, but to have such a long track record and such a high hit rate of being involved with poor performing companies is suspicious at the very least.
China Biologic Products Holdings (CBPO) is the exception to the rule - however, it’s worth-noting that the company was also invested by David Hui Li first through Warburg Pincus and then again after he started his own PE fund Centurium Capital, which is leading a deal to take the company private.
Centurium Capital is also the largest non-management shareholder of Luckin, currently with 18.1 million ADS (or 7.1% of the company) after selling down 5.5 million ADS in the company’s recent follow-on offering in January 2020.
As indicated in Red Flag #2 above, David Hui Li also directed Warburg Pincus’s investment into Charles Zhengyao Lu’s last public company CAR (699 HK) and was CAR’s second largest shareholder (after Lenovo) at its IPO.
It appears that the company’s management, key private investor, and independent board member have worked closely together for a long time.
Another interesting datapoint is that 10 out of the 18 companies disclosed in their latest annual reports that their internal control was not effective, mostly due to material weakness.
Red Flag #6: Luckin co-founder & Chief Marketing Officer, Fei Yang, was once sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment for crime of illegal business operations when he was the co-founder and general manager of Beijing Koubei Interactive Marketing & Planning Co.,Ltd.
Fei Yang is the co-founder & Chief Marketing Officer of Luckin, who architected the user growth model.
In 2013, as co-founder and general manager of iWOM (dt % 0 4% 2 ah 44 XI A IR 3), Fei Yang was caught and later sentenced to 18 months jail time® as he was compensated to delete negative online reviews for his clients, an illegal business in China.
Under Fei Yang’s leadership, iWOM bribed owners or editors of online forums/websites to delete negative reviews related to his clients.
Fei Yang co-founded this business in Jul 2007 with only a few people and limited capital but in 6 years time, it expanded into a several hundred people team with RMB 70 million revenue at 50%+ CAGR.
Another fact for consideration is that Fei Yang was supposed to stay in jail until Apr 16 2015 according to news*® but became UCAR’s CMO in Mar 2015, 1 months earlier than his release date.

Business Model Flaw #1: Luckin’s proposition to target core functional coffee demand is wrong: China’s caffeine intake level of 86mg/day per capita is comparable to other Asian countries already, with 95% of the intake from tea.
Different from the market leader Starbucks, Luckin’s management only focuses on catering to functional demand of Chinese consumers, i.e. caffeine in-take, but fails to recognize that China is a “stubborn tea drinking” society - such caffeine needs have already been fulfilled by tea products.
that, coffee is a very healthy functional beverage to keep people awake and energized... Chinese young people have strong needs to drink coffee for caffeine intake... Luckin’s core value proposition is to offer a coffee product that’s more attractively priced, more easily accessible, with comparable quality, by eliminating the price premium in Starbucks’ business model.
It is true that caffeine demand is real in China and coffee’s consumption level is still low compared to international peers.
However, coffee’s functional demand is likely a niche market given Chinese consumers’ caffeine intake has already been met with tea.
As shown in below chart, post joining WTO at the end of 2001, China witnessed accelerated growth in tea consumption per capita.
Coffee consumption per capita also experienced decent growth but absolute level remains low.

Another “stubborn tea drinking” society, India, also shows a similar level.

According to United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) data, global coffee consumption is mostly concentrated in Western countries and former colonies of Western countries — EU, the US and Brazil, representing 28%, 16% and 14%, respectively.
countries with strong tea cultures, such as China, India and Sri Lanka, the coffee consumptions are low.

Furthermore, it’s unlikely that coffee will play a greater role in Chinese consumers’ caffeine consumption in the future given that:

e Divergent store coverage and growth between freshly brewed tea vs. coffee: according to a report from Meituan (HKEX listed: 3690 HK, USD 72 billion market cap, the largest food delivery and local service platform in China), there are ~410,000 freshly brewed tea stores in China, 4 times of the number of freshly brewed coffee stores by 2018 3Q.

In contrast with Luckin, Starbucks China clearly knows that caffeine functional demand of coffee is not large enough.
After doing business in China for 20 years, Starbucks understands that in most of Chinese consumers’ mind, “grabbing a coffee” means more than meeting the caffeine intake demand, but more importantly, finding a place to hang out.
Chinese consumers often prefer sweet drinks such as flavored latte or Frappuccino over coffee.
Functional use: people drink coffee for caffeine to stay awake for study or work; they often become addicted
Therefore, Starbucks China is willing to pay high rent and renovation expenses for space and style.
What Chinese consumers are happy to pay for essentially is a stylish place serving beverages/food for meetings or leisure, not for the coffee itself.
Per management disclosure, 70-80% of Starbucks China’s stores are in shopping malls and its office location stores are mostly in tier 1 cities core commercial areas such as CBD in Beijing or Lujiazui in Shanghai
Such consistent performance in the past 20 years empowers Starbucks to establish an unmatched premium brand with a unique business model — it secures lower than market rate rent with long term leases at prime locations and carves out spaces for consumers, charging “rent” by selling them premium priced coffee.
It’s not surprising that Starbucks is the only coffee chain achieving a decent profitability in China.
All the competitors, including Costa Coffee, Pacific Coffee and Korean players, find it very difficult to replicate Starbucks’ success built on 20 years of brand value and accumulated store portfolio, and
In the table below, we list out the key differences in business model and culture between Starbucks and Luckin to help illustrate.

If expanding for the sake of scale is defined as success, it will eventually fail.
Refused franchise model in the brand-building stage; doesn’t want to lose the key connection to the customers: the store.
Through 2019 2Q, it had incurred RMB 2.9 billion net loss to amass 22.8 million cumulative transacting customers in just 6 quarters.
Chinese observers are so amazed by the persistently large and ever-present discounts, as well as Luckin’s unending appetite to expand and stomach more losses, that they are naming Luckin the “real badass nationalistic company”", due to its business model of raising capital from foreign investors to subsidize Chinese consumers.
We demonstrate below that both retention rate and transaction value are driven by product discount level.
Luckin’s new customers had progressively lower retention rates and worse quality than the early adopters, and 2).
retention rates across cohorts are driven by level of discount rather than customer vintage.
From 2018 2Q to 4Q, the quality of new users had been declining, and their retention rates range between 25%~30% or even 20%~25%.
2019 1Q and 2Q cohorts M1 retention rates recovered somewhat, but quickly plunge to 20%-25% or below within the first several months.
From August 2018, the retention rates started to rebound through second half of 2018 to December.
2019 1Q retention rates stayed high (Feb 2019 was abnormally low because of Chinese New Year and Luckin targets office demand).
The company’s customer cohort transaction value displays similar pattern to retention rate above.
'6 The company’s quarterly earnings material discloses average effective selling price and no.
Finally, transaction value, calculated on list price, grew sequentially from 2018 2Q to 3Q to 4Q as company increased the level of discounts.
Transaction value per customer (RMB, based on listed price)
The promotion ran from March 11" to May 19", and on average about 150k customers achieved the 7 products purchased per week.
Separately, we will discuss the positioning and competitiveness of the tea product in Flaw 4 later.
The number of items purchased per month by Luckin’s existing transacting customers have decreased.
As indicated above, a large percentage of new customers are attracted to Luckin due to the free cup, after which they become inactive.
If we exclude the impact of new customers, the number of items purchased per month by Luckin’s existing transacting customers had peaked in 2018 3Q at 6.2, and then steadily declined to 5.5 in 2019 2Q (2019 1Q was abnormally low due to Chinese New Year in February).
Luckin items purchased per month by transacting customers: all vs existing (excluding new)
The receipts we have recently gathered for company’s fraud investigation serves as another evidence.
In newer cities where Luckin needs to spend aggressively to “educate” consumers, the discount levels are higher.
However, the actual receipts show minimal correlation between the level of discount and the city’s operating history.
Luckin average effective price and discount level comparison by city (left to right by operation start date)
It’s not surprising that Luckin’s customer base is benchmarking its spending primarily to the level of discount.
Despite calling itself an internet company, Luckin’s APP is comparatively plain and simple; it doesn’t have any of the usual user engagement functions such as small games, sign-in awards, and flash sales etc.
Secondly, to reduce operating cost, Luckin has adopted the strategy to minimize human participation from all angles, including service.
Store level employees are not required or incentivized to interact with customers unless they have to.
Orders are placed online, and pick-up can be done by customers themselves through QR codes.
It calls baristas “partners” and pays higher than industry average for both full-time and part-time employees.
Thirdly, Luckin’s store decoration is also minimal and modularized: it aims to satisfy delivery and pick-up demands with no/few seats.
Fit-out period takes only 3 days and store can be open 2 weeks from rental contract signing, versus Starbucks/Costa at 3 months.
Because of the core strategy, Luckin needs to cut expenses to the bone and offers customers nothing more than the discounted products.
Our consumer survey shows exactly that: existing and potential customers’ perception of the Luckin brand highly associates with low price.
In fact, the top 3 impressions on Luckin are 1. the abundance of discount coupons, 2. cost effective, and 3. low price.

Worse still, Luckin pushes its coupon-centric operation model so far that it completes turns the table on its best customers: a normal, sensible business usually has a membership program to reward loyal customers, while Luckin’s “dynamic
Since December 2018, it’s free to register as a Starbucks member and get rated into three different levels according to accumulated consumption dollars.
On the other hand, Luckin doesn’t have a membership program or point system.
The discounts get progressively larger up to 82% off if the customer hasn’t ordered for a month.
Luckin’s strategy is to use larger discounts to reactivate marginal consumers, while core customers do not enjoy any additional benefits.
Management also frequently indicated that their strategy is to use large discounts to attract new customers, help them cultivate the habit of drinking coffee, and then increase the average selling price, i.e., price discriminate loyal customers.
Combining all the above, the truth of Luckin’s business model is that discount level is the key driver for its price sensitive customers.
By 2019 4Q, our investigation of the real business metrics indicates that even when the management further increases discount level (to 46% real case), number of items per store per day have started declining.
Coffee machines used in stores can be classified into three levels of automation.
Costa and Pacific Coffee use semi-automatic machines which require on-site baristas to manually make espresso and steam milk.
While KFC and convenience stores choose fully automatic machines because their on-site employees have many other things to do, Luckin also uses this type of machine because it can reduce labor costs and barista training to a minimum level.
From the customer’s perspective, coffee made by experienced baristas are considered premium: quality of coffee is higher, and the barista’s presence makes a difference in the customer’s mind.
Before we move onto examining Luckin’s store-level unit economics next, it’s important to highlight that, amongst different verticals in the food and beverage (F&B) service industry, coffee is categorized as one with mature supply chain, standardized production, and relatively high gross margin.
However, Starbucks is the only coffee retail chain that’s meaningfully profitable in China, which indicates that the key to profitability is not all about making and selling products, but more about finding a viable business model on the store level.
As comprehensively discussed in Flaw #1 and #2: on one hand, sales volume is capped by the limited end demand for coffee as a functional product; on the other hand, Luckin is not able to increase price and maintain sales volume simultaneously due to its highly price sensitive customer base.
When we add rental costs and headquarter expenses (part of which is spent to acquire new customers) to the equation, it’s clear that Luckin cannot turn profitable on store-level and the losses become worse on corporate level.
Luckin is incurring high operating losses on store-level, based on its real case sales volume and effective price.
We calculate Luckin’s store-level operating cost to be RMB 61.1k per month, which has limited room to be significantly reduced further.
As a result, Luckin effectively offers RMB 5 delivery subsidy per order.
However, delivery subsidy is directly resulted from selling and distributing products and can be attributed to each individual store.
More importantly, Luckin still cannot break even on store level on cash flow basis without considering depreciation.
In other words, Luckin’s upfront investment on equipment and decoration will never be paid back as the opened store continues to burn cash on a monthly basis.
As operating expenses are largely fixed and cost of raw material is proportional to revenue, daily items sold and effective prices after discount are the two key drivers for Luckin’s store unit economics.
The below sensitivity table showcases how changes in the two drivers, daily items sold and effective price, impact Luckin’s storelevel operating margins and corresponding payback period (in months).
In 2019 2Q, Luckin’s store is running at a negative 16.8% operating margin including the delivery subsidies.
Luckin’s stores usually have a lease term of 3 years, which means that the payback period needs be within 36 months.
Taking a step back, our research shows that there are three viable business models for freshly brewed drinks, and Luckin lacks the competitive advantage to develop into any one of them.
In the F&B service industry, items sold per store and effective price are usually negatively correlated.
Luckin’s competitors who succeeded have all found their own ways to strike a balance between volume and price.
Their investments in new stores can generate reasonable ROI due to this balance, which is the foundation for the business model to be viable.
“Third space”: Starbucks has built a premium brand in past 20 years in China and successfully offers the value proposition of a “third space” through selling coffee.
Although Luckin’s smaller store space enables cost savings on both upfront investment and daily operation, its store-level revenue and gross profit is only 17% and 11% of Starbucks by targeting the niche market of coffee’s functional demand.
As mentioned in Business Model Flaw #1 and #2, the success of Starbucks’ “third space” model is contingent on strong brand value and rental negotiation power, other followers (such as Costa Coffee and Pacific Coffee) are still struggling to break even.
It’s impossible for Luckin to replicate “third space” model given its different store design and brand positioning.
As a result, KFC and FamilyMart only need to purchase the coffee machine and raw materials without any additional rental and labor cost.
“Convenience store” model can achieve an ROI level similar to Starbucks despite much smaller sales volume.
Bubble tea shop: Yidiandian and Coco’s product pricing is comparable to Luckin’s.
However, their target market of tea drinks is much larger than coffee in China.
Being a top-tier tea drink shop can achieve very high sales volume per store.
Luckin will find it hard to replicate, since it mainly serves the functional coffee market and caffeine demand has been largely satisfied through tea in China.

However, capped by the market size and price-sensitive user base, it’s very difficult for Luckin to achieve either targets.
In reality, their store-level operating margin calculated from the real business metrics was likely negative 33% (inclusive of delivery subsidy).
As a result, it’s extremely difficult for Luckin’s sales volume per store to match its bubble tea peers such as Yidiandian and Coco.
Another restricting factor on volume is the fact that the majority of Luckin’s stores are located in office buildings, as it aims to satisfy functional demand.
The first requirement in Luckin’s own business development criteria is to position new stores in office buildings with >1.5k people.
We can also verify this by looking at Luckin’s monthly transacting customers per store: the metric centers around 2k.
With the sales volume upside handicapped, can Luckin shift towards the Starbucks’ model to improve its pricing power?
The answer is clearly a no, as Luckin’s customers are highly price-sensitive and lack royalty to its products and brand, and it cannot increase price without sacrificing sales volume significantly.
The two inherent flaws in its business model have been pushing Luckin away from any of the viable paths to profitability.
Luckin’s real case in 2019 3Q should have been unsurprisingly continued losses and no improvement in unit economics.
However, as we have shown in the Smoking Gun Evidence segment above, management had started to commit fraud by faking an inflection point of its business model: miraculously, they are able to dramatically increase sales volume per store with less discounts in 2019 3Q reported case and 4Q guidance, and investors mistakenly bought their story thinking that the business has turned the corner to become viable.
On top of the losses Luckin is racking up on store-level, its high and rising headquarter expenses also add insult to injury.
We have also derived in Business Model Flaw #2 that Luckin’s existing transacting customer buys on average 5.5 items per month.
Therefore, additional general and admin expenses for 688 new stores will cost the company another RMB 52.2 million per quarter.
Business Model Flaw #4: Luckin’s dream “to be part of everyone’s everyday life, starting with coffee” is unlikely to come true, as it lacks core competence in non-coffee products as well.
While demand is not the limiting factor for the tea drink industry, the main challenges lie in supply chain management and in-store production.
Supply Chain (food storage & preparation, inventory mgmt, On-site bulk/centralized procurement) cooking/baking/brewing
Correspondingly, tea drink consumers have developed discerning taste on flavors.

Major chains include Jieke Milk Tea (# &), Happy Lemon (1 R47 4®) and mom and pop shops.
o ©Mixue Bingcheng (% & “K3x) is another generation 2.0 chain; it targets lower tier cities with low priced products e Generation 3.0: tea drinks are made on the spot with real tea, cheese milk topping, and fresh fruits.
Major chains include HEYTEA (#48), Nayuki (48 49 4) and Lele Tea (KK #).
o Generation 3.0 is another significant upgrade from 2.0, with much better raw materials and correspondingly product price also increases from RMB 10-15 to RMB ~30 o In-store decoration of generation 3.0 brands are often more “instagramable”, and they also provide seats to better integrate the “3" place” strategy like Starbucks o Due to the raw materials upgrade and increased requirement for handling & processing of fresh fruits, the cost of generation 3.0 products is higher both from material and labor perspectives
Luckin has always been targeting an even simpler in-store production process than Starbucks to minimize the involvement of employees.
While Starbucks would mix different raw material powders, Luckin requires suppliers to blend as much raw material powers as possible into a condensed paste, which then can easily be mixed with water on-site to produce tea drinks.
To ensure quality and flavor, raw products such as tea leaves, fresh fruits and toppings are often directly sourced and selected.
On-site production is very labor intensive, as the fresh fruits are often peeled on the spot, and the cheese milk topping is blended and whipped by hand.
Luckin Tea can’t replicate HeyTea products given its R&D and supply chain model.
Below picture shows a series of Luckin Tea product: each drink’s texture appears even and balanced, indicating that it is blended from either NFC juice/jam; the bright color likely comes from artificial pigment.
Limited fruits, mainly citrus with longer shelflife, are added likely for decorative purposes.

own feedback is that they were on the right track to acquire younger customers with tea drink, but the products were not attractive to target consumers as they had hoped.

The HeyTea products below have uneven texture with obvious layers of tea, fruits and cheese milk topping.
Based on Meituan’s milk tea delivery industry report, only 7% of customers would choose full sugar / high sugar while sugar-free is the top option when choosing milk tea products.
Since taste is the key factor for tea drinks, and the consumption frequency is only once or twice a week, Luckin Tea likely will end up resorting to price competition with an inherently lower quality product.

We’ve divided Luckin’s 3"-party products by their distribution requirement and shelf life.
Luckin provides 34% discount for all lunches and light meals on its APP as well as various coupons to bring the effective price down further.
According to our research, customers think Luckin’s lunches and light meals are mediocre.
For example, Luckin’s salad has a big serving of veggies/fruits but little protein, and the taste is plain.
Thus, lunches and light meals are usually sold out by noon, which is quite uncommon in F&B industry.
NFC juices, bakery products and desserts also require cold chain supply.
Luckin’s NFC juices are OEM products supplied by Zero Fruit Farm (& /é R44).
Per our research, Luckin fits out its stores based on a “modularized” design to expedite its new-store deployment.
We’ve compared the prices of Luckin’s snacks and same products sold in other channels.

Per our research, Luckin’s procurement costs for 3"*-party F&B products are already very low.
Therefore, Luckin’s suppliers’ margin should be relatively low and there is very limited room for further reduce procurement price.
Luckin’s other F&B business is not competitive and cannot generate new traffic for its offline stores.
Unlike coffee, Luckin doesn’t use a consistent brand in its other F&B business.
3"‘-party snacks are widely available in other channels and often at a cheaper price, such as online ecommerce platforms and offline convenience stores.
Compared to these competitors, Luckin is much worse positioned with a lot smaller scale, very limited product SKU, inferior supply chain/inventory management expertise.
Instead, company requires the “New Retail Partners” to exclusively procure raw materials from Luckin and charges a share of gross profits after the store achieves gross profit breakeven!®.
